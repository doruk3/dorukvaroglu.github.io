# About Me:
Hello! I am Doruk and Welcome to my website! I've always been drawn to sports. One of my favorite sport is skiing even though Ican only go skiing during winter. I've been skiing since I was 4 years old. I’m currently taking AP CS A, and that’s what led me to start using GitHub. It’s been a great way to manage my code and collaborate on projects, helping me to understand version control and improve my coding skills
